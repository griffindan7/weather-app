# Weather App
Making a simple weather app in Android Studio

Checklist:  
-Download Android Studio.  
-Become familiar with Kotlin, a language I haven't used before.  
-Find an API to gather weather data. Decided to use WeatherBit.io

My main aim is to create a basic weather app that provides the user with  
weather information in their location. I also want the added functionality  
of searching for info in other areas.  
  
This is my first Android app so I am not going too extreme.
